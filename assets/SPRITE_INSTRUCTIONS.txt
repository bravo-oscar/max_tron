MAX TRON - Custom Bike Sprite Instructions

To use custom pixel art bikes in the game:

1. Save your cyan bike image as: bike_cyan.png (in this assets folder)
2. Save your orange bike image as: bike_orange.png (in this assets folder)

IMPORTANT:
- Both bikes should be facing RIGHT (→) as the base orientation
- Use PNG format with transparent background
- Recommended size: 40-80 pixels (game will auto-scale)
- Make the bike roughly square for best rotation results

The game will automatically:
✓ Load your sprites
✓ Rotate them for all 4 directions
✓ Add neon glow effects
✓ Scale them to fit the grid

If these files aren't found, the game will use the built-in drawn bikes.
